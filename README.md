# Ark-Nucleus-Localization

This repository contains the localization file for the Ark Nucleus mod.
The localization file is used to translate the Ark Nucleus mod into different languages.

## Localization Files

The localization files are in JSON format. The main localization JSON file can be found in the `nucleus-cca` directory named `localization.json`.

### Supported Languages

The supported languages for the Ark Nucleus mod are defined in the `languages.json` file. This file lists all the languages that the mod supports and matches the languages supported by the core game.
The supported languages are:

- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Russian
- Simplified Chinese
- Spanish
- Traditional Chinese
- Turkish

Additional languages may be added in the future.
*If you would like to contribute a new language, please submit a pull request with the new language added to the `languages.json` file.*

### Localization Strings

The localization strings are defined in the `localization.json` file.
Each string key has keys representing the supported languages and contain the translated strings.

The source language is English, and the translated strings are provided for each supported language.
*If you would like to contribute improvements to the localization, please submit a pull request with your changes.*

### Server Localization

The Ark Nucleus mod also supports server localization. The server admin can add or modify the translated strings for the mod using the Server Localization Manager.
The preloaded server localization strings are stored in the `server_localization.json` file and are used by the Demo Server Info Page.

## Usage

The localization file is used by the Ark Nucleus mode to translate the user interface and game content into different languages.

To use the localization file, the mod loads the `localization.json` file into memory and does so for all supported mods.
After that it updates it with the translated strings from the Server Localization Manager that may have been added by the server admin.

The mod then uses the translated strings to display the user interface and game content in the selected language.
